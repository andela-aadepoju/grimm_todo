### Grimm Todo App
Grimm App is the base app for Grimm gem. Clone the app to your local machine:

    $ git clone git@github.com:andela-aadepoju/grimm_todo.git
This app is a Todo app. Its will give you an insight on how Grimm can be used.


## Grimm Controllers

Controllers are made up of methods often called actions, that are executed on request. It either renders a template or redirects to another action among many othe functions.

For an app using Grimm, the controller class must follow the pattern below.

`ApplicationController` class inherits from `Grimm::BaseController`.  Every other controller class inherits from `ApplicationController` e.g  `ListsController << ApplicationController`

```ruby
class ApplicationController < Grimm::BaseController

end

class ListsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @lists = List.all
  end
end
```

Actions, render template in the app/views folder corresponding to the name of the controller and action after executing code in the action.

For example, the index action of the `ListsController` would render the template `app/views/lists/index.html.erb` by default after populating the `@lists` instance variable.

Also controllers should be named in their pluralized form. Controllers would render its corresponding views without the `@lists` instance.

The `redirect_to` method redirects to the specified route


## Grimm Models

Models are classes in the models folder. These classes are responsible for communications with the database.
All models should inherit from the `Grimm::GrimmRecord`. All model classes should be named as a singular object.

Example model class displaying available methods:

```ruby
class List < Grimm::GrimmRecord
  to_table :lists
  property :id, type: :integer, primary_key: true
  property :title, type: :text, nullable: false
  property :body, type: :text, nullable: false
  property :created_at, type: :text, nullable: false
  property :done, type: :boolean, nullable: false, default: false
  create_table
end
```

`to_table` This method is used to name the table in the database.

`property` This method is used to define the columns of a table in the database. As seen in the example above, the column type should also be defined on this method.

`created_table` This method triggers the main table creation.

## Grimm Views

`Grimm::BaseController` sends response to the views either by making use of render method declared within the controller method or by inferring the template to display from the name of the controllers. The render action looks for the corresponding views for every method in the controller. These files must be placed in a folder that has the same name as the controller.

The render method which enables rendering of ERB templates is automatically configured.
Objects can be passed from the controller to the view by either assigning them as instance variables or by passing the object as a parameter to the render method:

Having instance variable `@lists` makes `lists` object available to `views\lists\index.html.erb` and this is automatically rendered without explicitly calling the render method.

```ruby
def index
  @list = List.find(params["id"])
end
```

This method also renders the index template

```ruby
def index
end
```

## Parameters

All request parameters, whether they come from a GET or POST request, or from the URL, are available through the `params` method which returns a hash.

It's also possible to construct multi-dimensional parameter hashes by specifying keys using brackets, such as:

```html
<input type="text" name="lists[title]" value="Title">
<input type="text" name="lists[body]" value="Body">
```
The params can also be extracted into a private method such as `lists_params`

```ruby
def lists_params
  params[lists]
end
```
## Routes

Routes are HTTP methods paired with a URL matching patter, the first route that matches a request is invoked.
Route patterns may include named parameters, which can be gotten from the params hash:

They are defined in the file `config/routes.rb`

The `resources` makes available all the routes written below `resources :lists`
the `resources` method sets the default routes to the `index`, `new`, `edit`, `show`, `update`, `delete` controller methods.

Where `lists` is the name of the controller, and all words behind the `#` are action methods defined in your controller.

The `root` method is used to set the root path

```ruby

PostApplication.routes.draw do
  root "mypages#index"
  get "/all_posts", to: "posts#index"
  resources :posts
end
```

In the case of a request being made to an undefined route an error message is returned.

## Running the app
From terminal, run:

    $ bundle exec rackup

This will lunch the app on port 4500
